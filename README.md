# Chord Information Extractor

## Purpose
This Python project extracts chord information from MP3 files and converts audio to MIDI format using various music processing libraries. 
## Inspiration
I'm interested in exploring connections between music theory concepts and digital audio processing

## Libraries Used

- `music21`: For musical analysis and MIDI file handling.
- `librosa`: For audio analysis and feature extraction.
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `midiutil`: For creating MIDI files.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.

## Features

- Extracts chord/chord data from MP3 files 
- Converts audio to MIDI format
- Generates and displays Mel spectrograms of the audio
- Analyzes and suggests musical scales based on extracted chords


### Use

**Put mp3 files in the same folder as the one with the extracted repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/becksons/ChordDataExtractor.git
